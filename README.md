# How does it work?
Since recompilation of the generated LLVM IR is a goal of this project, we cannot rely on type information generated by Binary Ninja alone. Often, global or local structures or arrays are not detected properly, and relying on incomplete information leads to incorrect results.

Because of that, the plugin first creates a big global byte array, which holds all data of the data section. This ensures that all data, even if its type is not detected or if references are not detected, will make its way to the recompiled executable.

Next, the plugin iterates over all detected functions and lifts them to LLVM IR. Since no stack-based information is available in LLIR, we use a similar approach for the stack. We use a second stack, on which the lifted LLVM IR instructions operate. This allows us to direclty translate LLIR instructions which operate on the stack without any type information.
